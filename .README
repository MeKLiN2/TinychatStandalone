this project uses a 140mb binary file which ive uploaded to dropbox. the full project is available at archive.org/details/@meklin
originally, it contained a very old TES tinychat enhancement .js script file, but could not be implemented into tinychat version 420 webrtc
didnt try with anything else yet, not sure if it needs greasemonkey but dont think it will
this is basically a standalone chrome browser, but no location bar, etc. you will need to use the tinychat.com buttons to navigate to another room
as its set to join our old reddit9k room which is empty
